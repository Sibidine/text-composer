## Text Composer for WhatsApp

A simple collection of python scripts that generates 150-word text blobs for a particular group chat member using a [markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). To use this

- First, go to a WhatsApp chat of choice, and find the `export chat` option.
- On selecting it, select `without media` on the popup that appears, and transfer and unzip the zipped file created to where the script is to be executed/
- To access the script, run the following commands:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Sibidine/test-composer.git
  cd text composer
  python3 control.py {unzipped WhatsApp chat data}
  ```
